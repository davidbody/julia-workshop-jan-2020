    "The purpose of this first example is to introduce you to Jupyter Notebooks and to let you interact with some moderately complex Julia code. This code may appear mysterious and confusing now, but by the end of the workshop, we will have covered enough Julia so that almost all of this code will make sense.\n",

    "> *Note:* This example is inspired by a teaching approach described by [Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel](https://twitter.com/minebocek) in a lecture she gave at Harvard called *Let Them Eat Cake (First!)* You can watch a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsVOrpXAPXo\n",

    "Go ahead and press *Shift-Enter* again to execute the Julia code. This code loads some libraries we will need for the example and it will take a few seconds to run."
